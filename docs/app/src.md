# [`src/`](../../src/)
The most important directory is the `src/` directory where the core source code is located. Obviously... üòÅ

## The JavaScript files
### [`app_constants.js`](../../src/app_constants.js)
The suitable file to be introduced first into the project is the `./app_constants.js` where it contains the routes, information, error messages, and configuration data. It's just there since I just want to have an easy way of editing a bunch of settings while not going through each file replacing every one of them (though, I could use Visual Studio Code's directory-wide search and replace text function but you know...). 

### [`session_store.js`](../../src/session_store.js)
Next is the `./session_store.js`, it simply contains the session store to be used. It uses the [connect-mongo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-mongo) plugin for managing the session store. The sessions will be stored with MongoDB in the same database but in different collections. You can also see that the `./app_constants.js` is also used here for easily referring to the MongoDB database URL.

### [`cryptokey.js`](../../src/cryptokeys.js)
It's simply a JavaScript file that contains the cryptographic functions such as generating salt and the hash function. Also app constants are being used there (you see how they're everywhere).

### [`app.js`](../../src/app.js)
Last but certainly not the least (in fact, it's the most important) is the `./app.js` where it contains the creation of the Express application, middleware chaining, and configuration of the server.

```js
const express = require('express');
const session = require('express-session');
const helmet = require('helmet');
const cookie_parser = require("cookie-parser");
const nanoid_generate = require("nanoid/generate");
const dotenv = require("dotenv").config();
const logger = require("morgan");
const nanoid_url_friendly_alphabet = require("nanoid/url");
const bookmarkhub_router = require("./router");
const path = require("path");
const app_constants = require("./app_constants");   // remember this?
const session_store = require("./session_store");   // also this one?
```

In the first few lines until the first newline the dependencies used for the server. We've also imported the app constants from `app_constants.js` and used the session store from `session_store` as the location to where the sessions will be stored (is that enough redundancy for 'ya?).

Then the Express application is now created then a bunch of middleware chaining happened. 

```js
app
    .use(helmet())
    .set("views", path.join(__dirname, "views"))
    .set("view engine", "pug")
    .use(logger("dev"))
    .use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "../public")))
    .use(express.urlencoded({extended: true}))
    .use(express.json())
    .use(cookie_parser())
```

We can see the setting up of security headers from the [`helmet` plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet), configuring the view engine to be used (which is [Pug](https://pugjs.org/)) and the directory of the views (which is in `./views/`), the directory of the static files (which is in `../public/`), accepting data from HTML forms and JSON, and the ability to parse cookies from the request.

The next major thing is setting up the settings for web sessions and the user sessions:

```js
.use(session({
    cookie: {
        secure: true,
        maxAge: app_constants.cookies.MAX_AGE
    },
    genid: function(req) {return "_" + nanoid_generate(nanoid_url_friendly_alphabet, 64)},
    saveUninitialized: false,
    secret: process.env.COOKIE_SECRET,
    resave: true,
    store: session_store,
}))
```

I've followed (most of) the [recommended practices for setting secure cookies on the official Express docs](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-security.html#use-cookies-securely), read the [recommended settings for a secure cookie on the Express `session` plugin](https://github.com/expressjs/session), and read a bunch of articles of the use cases for the recommended settings. And that code is the result of those things. 

We can also see that the session store from `./session_store.js` is used here.

'K. Next part:

```js
.use(function(req, res, next) {
    if (req.cookies[app_constants.cookies.ERROR]) res.clearCookie(app_constants.cookies.ERROR);
    res.cookie(app_constants.cookies.SESSION_ID, req.sessionID);
    if (req.cookies[app_constants.cookies.USER_SESSION_ID]) res[app_constants.cookies.USER_SESSION_ID_COPY] = req.cookies[app_constants.cookies.USER_SESSION_ID];
    next();
})
.use(app_constants.app_configuration.home, bookmarkhub_router.home)
.use(app_constants.app_configuration.page, bookmarkhub_router.page)
.use(app_constants.app_configuration.account, bookmarkhub_router.account)
.use(app_constants.app_configuration.bookmarks_page, bookmarkhub_router.bookmark)
```

Next is a bunch of main routes and their subroutes with their responses stored from `bookmarkhub_router`. Go on, you can [quickly skim the code from the files in the [`../router/ directory`](../../router/) to get a general idea of the app. 

Might as well talk about the app constants from `./app_constants.js` that are starting to get spammed the crap out of it here. You'll get used it (hopefully).

Of course, there is also the obvious middleware function at the start of the code block which basically erases the cookies that serves as an error message handler but you'll get the whole picture of it once you see more of the codebase. Again, there is the spam of the app constants. Nothing to see here.

I've also followed the [best practices for maximizing performance](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-performance.html) as consistently as possible but you'd be the judge of that (and please do tell me how bad it is).

## [`views/`](../../src/views/)
I've used [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) as the view engine since I based it on the [Express generator scaffoldings](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) and I also saw a [demo](https://github.com/madhums/node-express-mongoose-demo) of the thing and it is exactly on the way on how I'll code the thing (except the demo uses with Passport).

Anyways, the `./views/` directory contains a bunch of `.pug` files.

The main pages are included within the `layout/` directory. The important template files here are:

- `./layout/default.pug` &mdash; it is the main template where the important HTML tags such as `<html>` and `<body>` (except for the `<head>`) is contained. All of the pages so far are generated with this template.
- `./include/head.pug` &mdash; obviously this contains the `<head>` tag and the usual needed tags like the `<title>` and a bunch of `<meta>` tags.
- `./include/header.pug` &mdash; this is the header template; contains the link for the usual user account actions
- `./include/footer.pug` &mdash; need to say more?

The remaining unmentioned files inside of the `./layout/` directory is the usual pages: the landing page, the help page, and the about page. 

There are also `.pug` files for the errors (like the `./error.pug`), signup and login templates, account page templates, bookmark container mixins, and the little things like the signup box when you're not logged in yet.

## [`style/`](../../src/style/)
The `.style/` directory simply the `.scss` files. How they're compiled is just by executing the npm scripts I've set up. You can compile them one time by running `npm run scss:build` but you can also watch the files by `npm run scss:watch` to get immediate feedback.

If you're familiar with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), specifically with the [default theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/master/_sass), you may also notice that the structure of the `.scss` files is quite similar and you'd be right.

The folder contains three `.scss` files which separates the styles for the components of the site:

- [`./_base.scss`](../../src/style/_base.scss) contains the default style of the elements
- [`./_layout.scss`](../../src/style/_layout.scss) contains the style of the layouts or elements with certain classes
- [`./main.scss](../../src/style/main.scss) contains the variables and the index file that connects all of the `.scss` files together

## [`models/`](../../src/models/)
The app uses [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/) as the database but since MongoDB is such a very kind database (or just doesn't give so much crap) that you, the developer, are in full charge and discipline to how will you handle your data. Which is why I use [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) to mitigate against that particular problem.

If you didn't get the context, MongoDB is not strict when it comes to forming data. Of course, that means the data can be horizontally scaled but that also means that you are going to be responsible and gather the discipline to make your individual data consistent and uniform. This is unlike SQL where it requires planning of modelling the data in the first place.

Mongoose solves that very problem by imposing modelling options and helper functions that usually comes with it like validations and data type setting.
